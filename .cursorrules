# Cursor Rules

## Folder Organization and Imports

When creating folders like `utils`, `components`, `hooks`, or similar utility/feature folders, **DO NOT** create index files (`index.ts`, `index.js`) to re-export everything from that folder.

Instead, import directly from the actual files:

**✅ Preferred:**
```typescript
import { formatDate } from './utils/date-formatter'
import { validateEmail } from './utils/validators'
import { debounce } from './utils/debounce'
```

**❌ Avoid:**
```typescript
// Don't create utils/index.ts that exports everything
export * from './date-formatter'
export * from './validators' 
export * from './debounce'

// Don't import from index files
import { formatDate, validateEmail, debounce } from './utils'
```

This approach:
- Makes imports more explicit and clear about what's being used
- Reduces bundle size by avoiding unnecessary re-exports
- Makes it easier to track dependencies and refactor code
- Prevents circular dependency issues
